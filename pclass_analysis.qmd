title: "Survival Rate by Passenger Class"
---

This page analyzes the survival rate of Titanic passengers based on their socio-economic class (Pclass).

First, let's load the necessary libraries and the dataset.

```{python} 
#| label: setup-libs-data-pclass
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

titanic_df = pd.read_csv('data/titanic.csv')
```

# Calculating and Visualising Survival Rates
```{python}
#| label: pclass-survival-plot
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| fig-cap: "Survival Rate by Passenger Class"

# Calculate survival rate by Pclass
pclass_survival_rate = titanic_df.groupby('pclass')['survived'].mean().reset_index()
print("Survival rate by Pclass:")
print(pclass_survival_rate)

# Create bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.barplot(x='pclass', y='survived', data=pclass_survival_rate, palette='viridis', hue='pclass', dodge=False, legend=False)
plt.title('Survival Rate by Passenger Class')
plt.xlabel('Passenger Class')
plt.ylabel('Survival Rate')
plt.xticks(ticks=[0,1,2], labels=['1st Class', '2nd Class', '3rd Class'])
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()
```

## Interpretation
The bar chart shows that passengers in first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in second and third class. Third class passengers had the lowest survival rate.
