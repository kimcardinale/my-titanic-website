title: "Age vs. Fare Analysis"
---

This page explores the relationship between passenger age and the fare they paid.

```{python}
#| label: setup-libs-data-agefare
#| echo: true 
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

titanic_df = pd.read_csv('data/titanic.csv')
```

# Scatter Plot: Age vs. Fare
For the following scatter plot, passengers with unknown age will be excluded to avoid errors in visualization.

```{python}
#| label: age-fare-scatter-plot
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| fig-cap: "Scatter Plot of Age vs. Fare, Coloured by Survival Status"

# Create a temporary DataFrame excluding rows with missing 'ag
titanic_age_fare = titanic_df.dropna(subset=['age'])
print(f"Number of passengers with known age: {len(titanic_age_fare)}")

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='fare', hue='survived', data=titanic_age_fare, alpha=0.7, palette={0: '#377eb8', 1: '#ff7f00'})
plt.title('Age vs. Fare of Titanic Passengers (Coloured by Survival)')
plt.xlabel('Age (Years)')
plt.ylabel('Fare Paid')
plt.legend(title='Survived (0=No, 1=Yes)')
plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()
```

## Interpretation
The scatter plot shows the distribution of passengers by age and fare. While there isn't a very strong linear relationship, we can observe that some younger passengers paid very high fares.
